54
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,290

55
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,420

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Did you order that, Yanami-san?</font>

64
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Karen-chan's a dear friend of mine. But...</font>

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But you know, she just
 transferred here in May!</font>

66
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,880
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Don't the twelve years I've known 
Sosuke count for anything?</font>

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'll ask one more time. 
Was it you who ordered the fries?</font>

68
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:51,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sosuke said he'd make me his wife. 
Isn't that mean? What a liar, right?</font>

69
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,850
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">When exactly did he say that?</font>

70
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It was before elementary school, 
so we must've been about four or five.</font>

71
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Yeah, that doesn't count.</i></font>

72
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Wait. Does this mean he's cheating on me?</font>

73
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Were you and Hakamada actually dating?</font>

74
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, gosh. I guess it probably looked that way.</font>

75
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So you weren't even going out? 
Then it's not cheating at all!</font>

76
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,210
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I-I mean, it was basically like 
we were half-dating, though.</font>

77
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if that soggy cow hadn't waltzed onto
 the scene, we'd probably still be together!</font>

78
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>Wasn't she a "dear friend" a moment ago?</i></font>

79
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,380
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But I get it.</font>

80
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If I'd worked up the courage sooner, 
things might not have turned out like this.</font>

81
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,320
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">W-Well, you might be right.</font>

82
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,010
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm sorry I'm such a mess today.</font>

83
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, it's totally fine.</font>

124
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,330
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Amanatsu-sensei's asking for you 
to go help in the printing room.</font>

125
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, really? I'm on my way.</font>

126
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu-kun, did you 
say that to help me out?</font>

127
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, kind of.</font>

128
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Thanks.</font>

129
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Another second and I'd have had 
a death grip on Karen-chan's boobs.</font>

130
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>How can she say that with a straight face?</i></font>

131
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, by the way, remember 
how I paid for you on Friday?</font>

132
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, yeah. Thanks for that.</font>

133
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I don't have my wallet on me, but maybe you 
can meet me at the emergency stairs at lunch?</font>

134
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh?</font>

135
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The fire escape staircase. 
In the old building.</font>

136
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,120
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sure. As long as you pay me back.</font>

137
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You know, they actually started dating.</font>

138
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So why did they ask me to 
eat with them? It's so weird.</font>

139
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,890
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And here I thought we were good friends.</font>

140
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder if they're trying 
to hurt me even more.</font>

145
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Ow, ow, ow. Thanks.</font>

146
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Amanatsu-sensei, aren't these 
the wrong lesson materials?</font>

147
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, I don't know who you think you are,
 but get it together, man!</font>

148
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,000
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">In second year, we cover the 
Byzantine Empire! Viva Byzantine!</font>

154
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that wild?</font>

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Please save me.</font>

saying you want me to die?</font>

160
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, no... Uh, good luck, I guess.</font>

161
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,220
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So about the money from before—</font>

162
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,100
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That night...</font>

163
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I even got a message from Sosuke's sister.</font>

168
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I wonder!</font>

169
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry.</font>

170
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,580
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I can't talk about this with any

 even an acquaintance.</i></font>

172
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,040
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So... do you think you can 
finally pay me back now?</font>

173
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,050
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here's the receipt from before.</font>

174
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,230
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yeah, thanks so much for that.
 You really saved my—</font>

175
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, my. Did the total go up?</font>

176
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yanami-san, you also got an order
 of watermelon pancakes, remember?</font>

177
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh-huh.</font>

178
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And you finished up with
 a pork shabu udon salad.</font>

182
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,940

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">but Sosuke used to say he really liked it.</font>

193
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,640

194
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,290

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">At least up to volume 5, when my favorite 
character starts turning to the dark side—</font>

246
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kaju.</font>

247
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Why are you in my room?</font>

248
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,560
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm in here most of the time. 
You just don't notice me.</font>

249
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>What a creepy thing to say.</i></font>

250
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So, big brother, have you 
made any friends at school?</font>

251
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,520
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Have no fear, big brother. I, Kaju, 
will find you some friends without fail.</font>

252
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,790
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">First of all, I'll make you a chara-ben.</font>

253
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,740
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kmff-rhf-bmf?</font>

254
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes! A character bento's a great 
conversation starter that'll win people over!</font>

255
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,730
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, uh, I've actually got someone 
making lunch for me for a while.</font>

256
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,750
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">B-B-Big brother, are you saying
 you're going out with a woman?!</font>

257
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">No, I'm not!</font>

258
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, of course not!</font>

259
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How could someone with 
no friends have a girlfriend?</font>

260
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But isn't it strange to have a non-friend 
non-girlfriend making lunch for you?</font>

261
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Well, I've actually paid for it.</font>

262
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, eating out with a working girl?</font>

263
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It must be one of those "bento lunch" things.
 My friends told me all about that.</font>

264
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,470
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Kaju.</font>

265
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Yes, what?</font>

266
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You need to find better friends.</font>

267
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Isn't that mean?</font>

268
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,080
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">What is?</font>

269
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm talking about you! 
I asked for your help yesterday.</font>

270
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,590
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I had to listen to the brand-new 
couple singing duets together.</font>

271
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Can you imagine how that felt?!</font>

272
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,530
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So what about my lunch?</font>

273
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Here you go.</font>

274
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, what's this?</font>

275
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I tried to make two bento 
lunches this morning,</font>

276
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:22,020
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">and my mom was like, 
"I'm sure Sosuke-kun will be thrilled!"</font>

277
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">This is convenience store food, right?</font>

278
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,310
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That's why I couldn't make enough for two.</font>

279
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,540
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>The packaging's clearly 
handmade, but still...</i></font>

280
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,510
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay. Let's say this is 268 yen.</font>

281
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Too cheap!</font>

282
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But that's the actual price.</font>

283
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Fine. 300 yen.</font>

284
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,760
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Anyway, why don't you keep 
your distance from those two?</font>

285
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,920
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Everyone's walking on eggshells
around me in class.</font>

286
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">'Cause, like, Sosuke and I used 
to be together all the time.</font>

287
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,560

That's the vibe right now.</font>

288

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm skipping my club today. 
Wanna go get something to eat?</font>

308
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,690
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Sorry. I have prep school today.</font>

309
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,940
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? You're still a first-year.</font>

310
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,140
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">If all you do is study, 
you're just gonna get dumber.</font>

311
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,630
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And if you don't study more, 
you'll end up repeating the year.</font>

312
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,060
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Mitsuki-san. We're going to be late 
to cram school if we don't get going.</font>

313
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,650
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, Chihaya. I'm coming.</font>

314

315
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,160
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? Oh... Bye-bye.</font>

316
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,250
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, are you and Mitsuki friends?</font>

317
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Uh, we're not exactly friends, 
but we go to the same cram school—</font>

318
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,170
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">So do you know who that girl was?</font>

319
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,600
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, Asagumo-san, I think?</font>

320
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">She and Ayano are both
taking the advanced course.</font>

321
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,700
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Advanced course, huh?</font>

322
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,680
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess Mitsuki's into smart girls after all.</font>

323
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,840
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lemon-chan, what are your intentions?</font>

324
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,190
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Huh? N-Nothing.</font>

325
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,800
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">It's just, we've been in the same 
class since elementary school...</font>

326
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">{\an8}Sounds like you're childhood friends.</font>

327
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,450
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Which means...</font>

328
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,900
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That woman is the homewrecker.</font>

329
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,820
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Oh, come on. "Homewrecker"?</font>

330
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,930
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Listen, Nukumizu-kun, 
there are only two types of girls.</font>

331
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,200
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">The childhood friend and the homewrecker.</font>

332
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,290
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I see.</font>

333
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,830
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>But what a contrast!</i></font>

334
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Hey, what do those two look like to you?</font>

335
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They seem pretty friendly, 
but didn't they meet just recently?</font>

336
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Maybe they're just plain friends.</font>

337
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Right! I'm sure they're just plain friends!</font>

338
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,430
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I knew you'd get it, Yana-chan!</font>

339
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lemon-chan, I kinda feel like 
we're not that different after all.</font>

340
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,810
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I'm rooting for you!</font>

341
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,150
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">They're asking me to hang out again today.</font>

342
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,130
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">"Wanna come study at Karen-chan's house?"</font>

343
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,490
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You should say no.</font>

344
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,980
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But if I don't go, 
it'll be just the two of them!</font>

345
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,620
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">That may be true, but where's my lunch?</font>

346
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu-kun, you ever think this 
might be why you don't have friends?</font>

347
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,710
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26"><i>I don't need that from you.</i></font>

348
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,740

349
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:38,240
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I only have one lunch box I can use, 
so I shoved the two servings into one box.</font>

350
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,090
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Okay, let's eat.</font>

351
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,300
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu-kun, how much is that worth?</font>

352
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,280
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Um, let's say 400 yen.</font>

369
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,270
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">How'd you know that?</font>

370

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Lemon-chan's so cool.</font>

372
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,570
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I guess I really got dumped.</font>

373
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:45,610
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I understood it in my head, but I don't 
think my body had figured it out yet.</font>

374
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,370
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I was here thinking, 
"Wow, Lemon-chan sure can run."</font>

375
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,180
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">And then it turned into 
"Wow, I sure got dumped."</font>

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Nukumizu-kun, maybe if you get dumped flat

<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">You think so?</font>

378
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,070
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Still, nothing changes after you've been dumped. 
Doesn't even feel like a fresh start.</font>

379
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,550
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">But still, everything around
 you keeps moving on,</font>

380
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,260
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">so you've got to keep moving, too.</font>

381
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,960
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">I've never been dumped before, 
so I don't really get it.</font>

382
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,420
<font face="Roboto Medium" size="26">Spoken like a lady-killer.</font>
